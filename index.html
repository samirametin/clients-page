        <h1>Our Clients</h1>
        <p class="about">It can be quite common within agencies—or any business,
            for that matter—to complain about how difficult clients are to please.
            And while I agree clients can sometimes be very challenging, it is, without
            a doubt, your responsibility to satisfy your clients. One that you and everyone
            on your team need to figure out if you want your business to thrive.It’s easy to
            get caught up in the work and trying to grow your own business that you make a
            lot of assumptions about clients and what they want and need. This post outlines
            some of the main things clients are looking for from their agency relationship.</p>
